# Udacity Data Science Term 2 Project 1

This project is for the Udacity Data Science term 2. 

The data set I chose to analyze was the stackoverflow 2017 survey. There are two files associated with this: survey_results_schema.csv and survey_results_public.csv.

The jupyter notebook contains my analysis of the data. Much of this analysis was exploratory trying to find a good topic to write on. After a couple of wrong paths I ended up on a question that piqued my curiousity, what do developers find most important in a candidate during the hiring process? 

I focused on what the respondents found to be important. How students differ from professional developers in what they believe is important? And lastly looked into whether developers with less than 5 years experience think differently than developers with more than 5 years of experience on what is important.

I posted my finding on Medium: https://medium.com/@mricksen/what-do-software-developers-look-for-in-candidates-when-hiring-future-colleagues-9191b59db098
