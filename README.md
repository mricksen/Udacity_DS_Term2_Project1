# Udacity Data Science Term 2 Project 1

This project is for the Udacity Data Science term 2. 

The data set I chose to analyze was the stackoverflow 2017 survey. There are two files associated with this: survey_results_schema.csv and survey_results_public.csv.

The jupyter notebook contains my analysis of the data. Much of this analysis was exploratory trying to find a good topic to write on. After a couple of wrong paths I ended up on a question that piqued my curiousity, what do developers find most important in a candidate during the hiring process?
